## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
* Go to https://gitforwindows.org/ and follow the directions to download and install `git` 
* Locate and open the terminal in VSCode (using Ctrl or Command + `)
* Remotely connect to the `ieng6` server using the ssh command `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the zz replaced with the course specific username

You will likely see a message like:
`The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? `

* Type `yes` and press enter
